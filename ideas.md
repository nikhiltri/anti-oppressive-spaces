# Broader ideas

## Create relationships and co-create with people of color
Share institutional power. People of color are going to create content
more interesting to people of color

## Find out how to connect your work with movements
GET OUT of the museum. Join organizations that are advocating for
social justice issues or movement.

## Create work based on the needs of people
“Design for your community, not for the world.” Invest time in
communities that are being affected by the presence of museum, of
histories hidden in the archive, or not told in exhibitions.

## Identify reusable wins

## Use money to subsidize programming

## Critique your organization’s inclusion work
Leadership must make inclusion a priority and a lens through which all
work is approached. Critique your organization's inclusion work based
on:
- What they do
- What they think they do
- What they won't do

## Share relevant articles about pressing issues
