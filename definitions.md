# Definitions

## Anti-oppression
An approach to work that focuses on ending
oppressions. Focusing our work in this way takes for granted that we
live in a society where social groups use power or privilege for their
own benefit while disempowering, marginalizing, silencing and
subordinating other groups. It recognizes that oppressions operate at
many levels, from internalized to systemic, and it considers how
historical traumas affect the relationships between social groups
today. Working from an anti-oppressive frameworks is about centering
justice and transforming ourselves, our relationships and our
institutions.

## Inclusion
The act to accommodate people that are presently excluded
from our institutions. This is an approach this has been popular in
higher education and corporate workplaces in recent years, and is a
term that’s often coupled with diversity. Inclusion is about being a
part of systems that are already oppressive.

## Diversity
Acceptance or promotion of multiple identities within a
single institution. Diversity has been criticized for putting too much
onus on numbers of people, versus considering the actual people the
numbers represent. Often read as a codeword for talking about race.

## Intersectionality
A theory that examines how various categories of
identity such as gender, race, class, ability, sexual orientation,
religion, caste, age, nationality and others interact on multiple and
often simultaneous levels. We should think of each element or trait of
a person as inextricably linked with all of the other elements in
order to fully understand one's identity. The term was first coined by
critical race theorist Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw in the late
1980s. Read some of Crenshaw's talk at TEDWomen 2016 [here](http://blog.ted.com/the-urgency-of-intersectionality-kimberle-crenshaw-speaks-at-tedwomen-2016/).

## Community
Often seen as a codeword for talking about people of
color.

## Gender binary
The classification of sex and gender into two distinct,
opposite and disconnected forms of masculine and feminine. Assumes
one's sex, gender and sexual orientation are by default aligned. For
example, someone assigned male at birth would be assumed masculine in
appearance, behavior and character traits, including a heterosexual
attraction to those assigned female at birth.
