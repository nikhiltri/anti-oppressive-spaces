# ENACTING INCLUSION
> A Pathway Towards an Inclusive Museum

## A Cross-Contextual Approach:

Whether you are working in/with:
- Graduate Programs
- Association/Professional Network
- Small Museum
- Large Museum

The following sections should speak to functions and contexts that you are
familiar with in your day-to-day experience. While some of these evaluation
items are context specific, some items apply across every context mentioned
above. This is not to say that fulfilling each of these aspects of inclusion
will look/feel the same in every institution. Far from it. However, these items
can act as shared values from which to build an intentional, inclusive response
to a unique context.

## Shared Values:

- Inclusion integrated as core value rather than topic
  - Is inclusion work siloed in one position, department or issue addressed through
    one-off programming? Alternatively, how can inclusion be understood as both an
    institutional change process and a core value that each person within the
    institution commits to working on in their respective roles?
- Center Marginalized Voices / Decenter Whiteness
  - Does your institution/organization rely on narratives that take as their
    starting point the experiences of white (and/or straight, cis, male people who
    have no visible disabilities)? Set a priority to share stories of those with
    different perspectives as your starting point to counter this bias.
  - Do you recruit leadership that represents marginalized groups? Are they able to
    direct the overall development of your institution? Do you invite advisory
    leadership from marginalized communities in the telling of narratives focused on
    them or development of the storytelling media? If you plan to center narratives
    of marginalized groups/communities, how are you consulting with and listening to
    individuals from these groups?
- Community Asset Driven
  - Community Listening Focus
  - Communities grouped as status/identity specific not viewed as monolithic
- Building Staff Analysis of Inclusion Vocabulary
  - What words do you use to describe or talk about inclusion in your institution?
    Where do they come from? Does everyone in your organization use the words the
    same way or understand them the same way? What new words/concepts are tools
    useful to your work?

## Context Specific Values:

### SPATIAL/INTERPERSONAL/CURATORIAL
> Within Design (Architectural, Graphic), Exhibits, Collecting, Programs, Events (All Ages):

- Collaborative Process
- Cross-Sensory experiences
- Quiet Spaces
- Accessible Online Promotional Information
- ADA Accessible - Space and Bathrooms
- Gender Open Restrooms
- Gender Neutral Language if Gender Isn’t Specified
- Create Space for Individuals to Share Pronouns if Desired
- Baby Changing Space
- Nursing / Breastfeeding / Pumping space and/or Childcare Provided
- Scent-Free Space
  - Is your public space, program space and exhibit space scent-free? If not,
    consider a scent-free policy. This will also influence the selection of cleaning
    products. For artworks or interactives that have an olifactory element, make
    sure that visitors and staff are given the opportunity to consent/ opt into or
    out of that experience. Post signs in the space and on your website.
- Space planning for Visitors on the Autism Spectrum
  - Is your public space, program space and exhibit space low-sensory? If not,
    consider a low-sensory policy. For artworks or interactive components with high
    or multi-sensory elements, make sure staff and visitors are given the
    opportunity to consent/ opt-in opt out of the experience. Post signs in the
    space and on your website.

### PROFESSIONALIZATION

  Skill Building Around Empathy, Difference and Creating Safe Spaces

  - Sub-Group of staff Cultural Competency Work if Applicable: White Privilege
    - Do you have a space for white people to work out their questions, concerns and
      build their understanding of concepts like white privilege together? A space
      such as this can insure support for white people in becoming allies, while
      making sure that large group, multi-racial conversation about inclusion can
      de-center white voices.
- Core course literature de-centers whiteness and is representative of academics
  or writers of marginalized communities ( ie racial, ethnic, ability, sexuality
  and gender etc.)
- Faculty and/or guest speakers are representative of individuals of marginalized
  communities
