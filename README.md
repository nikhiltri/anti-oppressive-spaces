# Creating Anti-Oppressive Spaces in Museums

This project contains a set of tools that museum workers can use to
ensure that our oeganizations and projects remain as inclusive as possible. Here's what
you'll find:

- Checklists - These contains the bulk of the info we're presenting.
  - [Organizational Checklist](checklist-organizational.md) - A list of shared
    values by context.
  - [Tech Project Checklist](checklist-tech.md) - A series of questions to ask at the
    beginning, middle and end of tech projects.
- [Ideas](ideas.md) - Contains some bigger ideas we advocate for.
- [Tools](tools.md) - Additional tools you may find helpful.
- [Definitions](definitions.md) - We've defined some of the terms we
  use here.

## About
This repository began with the Tech Project Checklist that was developed in conjunction with the panel _Creating Anti-Oppressive Spaces Online_ at the [2016 meeting of the Museum Computer Network](http://conference.mcn.edu/2016/index.cfm).

> Does your sign-up form reinforce binary notions of gender? Does your latest web project unintentionally exclude visitors with different abilities, or from different backgrounds? Many of us are interested in creating anti-oppressive spaces in our work--those that share power more equitably, are representative of the places our institutions reside, and account for the traumatic histories that allowed many of our institutions to be established. This brainstorming session will look at existing spaces that have thought well in this area, and radically imagine what might be possible in the future. Attendees will walk away with a number of concrete ideas that they can apply to their current and future projects, which in incremental ways will push our sector towards a more just future that centers more and more people.

At the same time, The Incluseum was working on a similar effort, which has
become the Organization Checklist. Because of the overlap in our efforts, we
decided to combine our work.
