# Creating Anti-Oppressive Spaces Online

This project contains a set of tools that museum workers can use to
ensure that our projects remain as inclusive as possible. Here's what
you'll find:

- [Checklist](checklist.md) - This contains the bulk of the info we're presenting.
- [Ideas](ideas.md) - Contains some bigger ideas we advocate for.
- [Tools](tools.md) - Additional tools you may find helpful.
- [Definitions](definitions.md) - We've defined some of the terms we
  use here.

## Get involved

We see this very much as a work in progress, and we're happy to do so
openly. We're always open to your suggestions, criticism and
feedback. There are lots of ways to get involved!

### Reach out to one of the contributors
You can ping any of us on Twitter to chat about your ideas. Our
contact info is below under [Contributors](#contributors).

### Create an [issue](issues)
All our conversations will eventually make their way to this project
as an issue. If you'd like, create the issue directly! It's as
straightforward as sending an e-mail. You'll need to be logged into
GitHub.

### Make the changes yourself
GitHub has a mechanism for contributing to projects called [pull
requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). If
you're feeling fancy, clone this project, make your own changes, and
submit a pull request. We can make comments and have a conversation
on your changes, and you can continue to make edits, before they get
added to the main content.

## About
This repository was developed in conjunction with the panel _Creating Anti-Oppressive Spaces Online_ at the [2016 meeting of the Museum Computer Network](http://conference.mcn.edu/2016/index.cfm).

> Does your sign-up form reinforce binary notions of gender? Does your latest web project unintentionally exclude visitors with different abilities, or from different backgrounds? Many of us are interested in creating anti-oppressive spaces in our work--those that share power more equitably, are representative of the places our institutions reside, and account for the traumatic histories that allowed many of our institutions to be established. This brainstorming session will look at existing spaces that have thought well in this area, and radically imagine what might be possible in the future. Attendees will walk away with a number of concrete ideas that they can apply to their current and future projects, which in incremental ways will push our sector towards a more just future that centers more and more people.
