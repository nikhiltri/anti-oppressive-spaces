# Take 5 minutes at the beginning of a design phase to consider how to make your project anti-oppressive

Here is a basic checklist of things to consider in your tech
projects. Plan to run through this checklist a few times throughout
your design and development processes. More details on each item are
included below.

- Are your sign-up forms respectful of people outside the norms of
  names, gender, sexuality, relationships and ethnicity?
- What data are you collecting? Why are you collecting each piece of
  data? Is your intention conveyed to users? Does the project respect
  the privacy of users?
- If you collect comments that will be made public, do you have
  guidelines for discourse in place?
- Do icons, photos, etc. assume things about gender, race or ability of users?
- Have you staged any photos that inaccurately reflect the diversity
  of your visitorship or staff?
- Have you been sure not to make business decisions based solely on existing analytics? Do you have a
  clear plan on how to measure the business decisions you've made,
  through analytics or otherwise?
- What modes of communication do your teams use? Is that working for everyone?
- Is the project accessible to older people, younger people, people without
  disabilities, and people with disabilities?
- Is all the writing, including curatorial content, at an accessible
  reading level?
- Who’s not part of your design process? Why?

## Are your sign-up forms respectful of people outside the norms of names, gender, sexuality, relationships and ethnicity?

**Collect all user data in changeable, free-form text fields**

Limited lists of values for fields like name, gender, ethnicity and more
don't often work in real
life. [W3C](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-personal-names)
has a good write-up making the case for why names don't fit the schema
of first name-last name for many people. One alternative they suggest
is to ask for the full name in one text field, then ask how your users
would like to you to call them in another field:

![Screen capture of two fields on a form titled "Your Profile." The
 first text-box is labeled 'Full name,' the second is labeled 'What
 should we call you? (for example, when we send you mail?)'](images/profile-names.png)

Likewise with gender and
ethnicity, these are identities that people choose for ourselves, and
we can change the way we think about them over the course of our
lives.

![Screen capture of a radio list form field labeled 'Gender.' The only
 two options are 'Male' and 'Female.' Neither value is selected and a
bright red alert appears that says 'Gender is
 required.'](images/gender-rdio.png) ![Screen capture of a text form field labeled 'Your gender.'](images/gender-diaspora.png)

## What data are you collecting? Why are you collecting each piece of data? Is your intention conveyed to users? Does the project respect the privacy of users?

**Be clear on why you're collecting each piece of data and what you’re
doing with it**

Privacy of users in particularly important for online visitors in
another country looking at content that might be considered restricted
in their country of origin - gay rights, political content, etc). Read
more on why privacy is important by Cory Doctorow [here](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/jan/15/data.security).

## If you collect comments that will be made public, do you have guidelines for discourse in place?

**Establish guidelines for discourse online**

See the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org), [The
Universal Rules of Civilized
Discourse](http://blog.discourse.org/2013/03/the-universal-rules-of-civilized-discourse/),
and a good example of a Code of Conduct by [Hypatia Software
Organization](http://hypatiasoftware.org/code-of-conduct/).

## Do icons, photos, etc. assume things about gender, race or ability of users?

**Use non-gendered, raced, or abled user icons**

Here are some good examples from Twitter, iPhone, Slack, Flickr and Wordpress:

![Screen capture of a Twitter user photo that hasn't been set yet. It
 defaults to a white silhouette of an egg over a bright colored
 background.](images/twitter-egg.png) ![Screen capture of an iPhone contact photo that doesn't have an image
 set for it. It defaults to a grey circle with the users initials in
 white text.](images/iphone-initials.png) ![Screen capture of a Slack user's icon that doesn't have an image
 set for it. Defaults to a close-up of the center of their icon done
 in different colors.](images/slack-hash.png) ![Screen capture of a Flickr user's icon that doesn't have an image
 set for it. Defaults to an illustration of a different type
of camera done in different colors.](images/flickr-camera.png) ![Screen capture of a Wordpress user's icon that doesn't have an image
 set for it. Defaults to a symmetrical, geometrical pattern of
polygons done in a different bright color for each user.](images/wordpress-geometrics.png)

## Have you staged any photos that inaccurately reflect the diversity of your visitorship or staff?

**Don't stage false diverse photographs**

![Screen capture of the homepage of NOMA's online
 shop. Seven figures are seen looking at items in the shop, with a
 Black woman featured prominently in the center of the image.](images/noma-shop.png)

Inspiration porn of images of people with disabilities in museums also
falls into this category.

## Have you been sure not to make business decisions based solely on existing analytics? Do you have a clear plan on how to measure the business decisions you've made, through analytics or otherwise?

**When using analytics: Decide, then act, then measure. Don't measure,
then decide, then act.**

## What modes of communication do your teams use? Is that working for everyone?

**Consider and critique modes of communication: face-to-face, e-mail**

## Is the project accessible to older people, younger people, people without disabilities, and people with disabilities?

**Implement Universal Design and Learning**

## Is all the writing, including curatorial content, at an accessible reading level?

**Check the readability grade level of your text**

Use services like [this one](https://readability-score.com/) to see
what grade level is of the text in your project. Is all above a high
school reading level? Is that ok?

## Who’s not part of your design process? Why?
